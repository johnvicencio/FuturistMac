# Futurist for Mac using C#!
Futurist for Mac is a macOS version of a C#-based ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly web app designed to generate random answers for personal questions about the future. The app utilizes a JSON file as its database, which contains a comprehensive list of all possible answers. The selected answer is dynamically displayed on the user's browser using a logical mechanism implemented within the app.

## Problem
How to create a desktop interface so that the user enter's a question about the future and the application shows a prediction based on that question. Replicate the Futurist web app version (https://futurist.mythoslife.com) into a desktop app. You do not need a database.

## Solution
To develop a desktop interface where users can enter questions about the future and receive corresponding predictions, you can replicate the functionality of the Futurist web app version into a desktop application without the need for a database.

Here's an outline of the process:

1. Design the Desktop Interface: Create a user-friendly interface that includes an input field for users to enter their questions and an area to display the generated predictions. Use appropriate UI elements and styling to provide an intuitive user experience.
2. Implement the Prediction Logic: Utilize algorithms or models to generate predictions based on the user's question. This logic can be implemented within the desktop application without the requirement of a database.
3. Capture User Input: Retrieve the user's question from the input field in the desktop interface. You can use appropriate event handling mechanisms to capture the input when the user submits their question.
4. Generate Predictions: Apply the prediction logic to the user's question and generate a prediction based on the provided input. This can be done using the algorithms or models implemented in the application.
5. Display Predictions: Show the generated prediction in the designated area of the desktop interface. Update the output area dynamically with the predicted response.
6. Test and Refine: Thoroughly test the desktop application to ensure it provides accurate predictions and a smooth user experience. Iterate and refine the application based on user feedback and usability testing.

By replicating the functionality of the Futurist web app version, you can create a desktop application that allows users to input questions about the future and receive corresponding predictions. This can be achieved without the need for a database by implementing the prediction logic within the application itself.
